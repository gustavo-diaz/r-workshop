# Overview

The R Workshop is a year-long series that meets three times per quarter during the academic year. The purpose of the workshop is to learn, practice, and update cutting edge statistical programming skills as they apply to quantitative and computational social science.

Each workshop meeting will feature an introduction to a new tool/method/approach and practice. The workshop is open to everyone, but those formally enrolled will receive full credit by attending to every meeting. Meeting times are TBD (unsure if there will be a pre-determined time or if we can arrange it on our own).

The aim is to present topics that are equally useful for new and advanced users. So if you see a topic that you are already confident on, chances are that you will still learn something new.
